  Hello! My name is Pratham, and I am a data science student at Michigan State University. I currently intern at GE Aerospace, actively engaged in projects creating data pipelines 
  capturing telemetry from Azure M365. At MSU, I conduct undergraduate research involving EEG analysis and DenseNets. Additionally, I lead the AI Club as well as the Finance team 
  for SpartaHack. 

  As an aspiring data scientist, I am committed to honing my skills and acquiring practical experience through higher education and internships. Proficient in Python, R, and SQL, 
  I am passionate about leveraging these skills to drive insights and innovation. I am eager to connect, collaborate, and contribute â€” feel free to message me!
